# After downloading the project as zip or by cloning it:

* Open teddy.m and then run the script. 
* Training time is 4-5 min
* Then a camera will popup along with another window that have the capture button 


# This code recognizes dollar bills, faces and laptop for now but you can easily extend the number of classes if you want. 

# Note For Detection:

* The object should cover 70-80% of the camera live stream in order for the code to detect it.
